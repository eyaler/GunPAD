# GunPAD
A minimal [gunDB](https://github.com/amark/gun) collaborative notepad.

Add `#yournotepadname` to the URL for a designated notepad.

Short link: [tfi.la/g](https://tfi.la/g)

*Warning: everything is ephemeral!*

### Use as a temporary URL shortener

Use `?yournotepadname` in the URL (instead of the hash) to grab and open the first URL from the notepad.
You can omit the `/g` from the short link, e.g. [tfi.la?short](https://tfi.la?short) (currently points here, but may change...)
